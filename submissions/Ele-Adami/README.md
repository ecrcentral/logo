About the logo>
I have chosen different colours for the 3 main shapes to represent different disciplines. 
The shapes intersect and this symbolises the collaboration and the inclusion of early career researchers from different backgrounds in the ECR network.

In logo-3 colours are matched with the eLIFE logo, to hint at the connection between elife and the ECR network.
