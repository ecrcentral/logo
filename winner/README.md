# ECRcentral logo


ECRcentral is a central platform for early career researchers community to find and discuss funding opportunities, share experiences, mentor peers, and create impact through community engagement.

The icon is derived from a globe subdivided with selective latitude and longitude lines to represent ECR (early career researchers). The segments created contain the letters "e" "c" and a side segment as been added to allow for formation of the "r".
